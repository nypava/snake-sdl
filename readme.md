This is a classic Snake game written in C using SDL, but itâ€™s more challenging than the traditional version.

The game has two modes: "reverse" and "normal", the reverse one inverts directions, whereas the normal one acts normally. This game alternates betweeen these modes as the score progress (every 10 points scored).
